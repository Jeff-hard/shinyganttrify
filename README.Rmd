# shinyganttrify

You like Gantt charts as produced by the [`ganttrify` R package](https://github.com/giocomai/ganttrify) but you're not really into R? Or perhaps, you really just want to empower your colleagues to make nice-looking Gantt charts. Well, here you are, and you're very welcome.

With `shinyganttrify` you create Gantt charts directly through a web interface: you can use the [version kindly hosted by EDJNet](https://ganttrify.europeandatajournalism.eu/), or you can run it locally, running `shiny_ganttrify()` just after installation.

## Installation

Make sure to install also the [`ganttrify` package](https://github.com/giocomai/ganttrify), otherwise it won't work.

``` r
remotes::install_github("giocomai/ganttrify")
remotes::install_github("giocomai/shinyganttrify")
```

## How does this work?

After you've installed the package, all you need to do is to run the following line:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
shinyganttrify::shiny_ganttrify()
```

And this is what you should see right in front of you:

You can check it online with no further ado at the following link:

(N.B.: not all features are exposed in the shiny app)

### Shiny app on Docker

Alright, you don't know like R, but you know how Docker works?

This is all you need to find yourself a nice web app on `localhost`

```
docker run -p 80:80 giocomai/ganttrify
```

## Disclaimer and funding

`shinyganttrify` has been created with and for [EDJNet, the European Data Journalism Network](https://europeandatajournalism.eu/).
